# Home Cinema
This program forms part of a home entertainment system.\
Written in python, it makes use of Natural Language Processing and SQLite to interact with a database of movies.\
The lean program allows a user to:
* browse the movie library by genre, director or to view new releases,
* search for a movie by title, genre or other keyword,
* explore recommended titles based on watched movies.


## Installation

You can set the directory path and run the python file as usual.

```bash
python home_cine.py
```


## Functionality

The program can be further developed with expanded browse and search functions.\
A password-protected user account feature can also be added, so that favourite and watched lists can be linked to individual users -- allowing for more accurate movie recommendations.


## Development

Do not hesitate to send a [message](https://github.blog/2011-03-23-mention-somebody-they-re-notified/) if you would like to contribute.
